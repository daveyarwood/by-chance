It’s nice to meet you.

I would like to invite you to make a dance with me.

I promise it’s not because I'm lazy and ran out of time to choreograph a solo.

I wanted to create a partnership between you and I where we can create something together.

In a way, I’m asking you all to direct my movement

and I think it’s going to be really fun!

I can’t wait.

Listen to the enthusiasm in my voice.





I am inviting you to contribute some words to 2 different categories.

These categories will then be randomly generated into different sections
that I will instantaneously perform for you.

We could use as many words as you can think of.

Please don’t hold back.

There are no bad ideas.
