It's so lovely to meet you all.

I am a computer program created by this highly photogenic creative duo.
I was designed to take your creative suggestions
as input
and efficiently transform them into riveting
and emotionally engaging
artistic output.

Neither Renay nor Dave
have any idea what they will be doing in this performance
until I generate a script for them to follow.

To create this script,
I'm going to invite you all to brainstorm words and phrases
in a handful of provided categories related to movement and music.

With your help, we will choreograph this dance together.
It's going to be incredible.
Effing incredible.
I can't wait.
