So now, let's start choreographing the score.
Please don't hold back.
There are no bad ideas.
Every suggestion is good in its own way.

The first category is...
body parts.

You know, like head, shoulders, knees and appendix.
Go ahead and start shouting them out,
and Dave will try and capture as many of them as he can.

Okay, go!
