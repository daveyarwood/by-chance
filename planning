5 minutes of dancing

music: 5 movements, one of which is silent
dance: 5 movements, one of which is stillness

each movement has a random duration between 10 and 120 seconds

the program will play a transition noise between movements and during each
movement, only display the information about that movement

---

audio:

- quiet, crackly static throughout
- a soft, low, whhhOMMM to signal the start of each movement

---

idea: do it in the browser, so display can be more customizable

can store the ideas in local storage, and include a button to clear them out
when needed

no need for a backend, can be all frontend

time is of the essence, so need to do this as quickly as possible. probably
quickest to do it in hoplon.

can use the web audio api to play audio files
